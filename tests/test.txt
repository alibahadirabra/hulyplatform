Dear Founder, 

Here is my humble suggestions for your company’s project(now). 


- Suggestions for improvement of your project.
1 It’s necessary to resize the All-hands meeting room. It's not suitable when if the number of all employees exceeds 30.

2 Even when an employee is selected as the team leader, the department is not automatically set for the leader. 

3 In projects, new issues or tickets can be assigned to employees who have not joined the project. Implement a check to restrict issue assignment only to project members to ensure accountability and relevance.

4  When a milestone is deleted, it is not possible to touch other milestones on the board until the page is refreshed.

5  It's a good idea to allow employees to join several teams, not just one team.
Please allow employees to join multiple teams rather than restricting them to just one team would enhance collaboration and resource utilization. Implement a feature to enable multi-team membership for greater flexibility.


And here are my creative opinions for Project Implementation
1.Your team should integrate with various third-party services such as GitHub, GitLab, version control systems to streamline development workflows.

2.You should implement comprehensive monitoring of all developer actions, including commits, PRs, merges, and pipelines, to enhance oversight and productivity.

3.You need the common tools service to ask the any question realtime like community, to allow team members to ask questions and share knowledge instantly.

4.You should integrate with cloud services and analytics tools like AWS, GCP, Datalog, Heap and others to leverage their capabilities

5.You should develop the bot to notify the all comments that have not received a response, ensuring timely communication and issue resolution for each ticket management.

6.For enhanced security, you should divide the channels to manage the security tickets like business and marketing problems for product team.

7.It’s necessary to improve the UI to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for all users.

8.You should implement the User management system with detailed role management to ensure appropriate access control permissions.

9. You should facilitate efficient collaboration, introduce tools and features that promote seamless teamwork and communication.
